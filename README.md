This is a simple React application that fetches a list of persons from an API and displays them with pagination. It shows 10 persons per page, and you can navigate through the list by clicking the "Next" button to view the next set of persons.

## **Technologies Used**

- React (using React Hooks - `useState`, `useEffect`)
- CSS for styling
- Fetch API to get data from the mock API

---

## **How to Run the Application**

1. **Clone the repository** or create a new React app: 
   -I'm giving repository URL `https://github.com/Deepika2890/Pagination.git`
   -Also I'm giving published URL so that you can go through a live view https://pagination-plum.vercel.app/
   -npx create-react-app Showcase-Application
   -cd showcase
   -npm start

## **Can Be Do Better**

    -I have done this sample application based on the inputs from interviewer.
    -It will be more helpful for me if you may provide proper description, what I have to display and what features I have to  add to it. 



## CONCLUSION*** 
-This project demonstrates how to create a paginated list in React using Hooks and how to fetch data from an API to display it in chunks. The application fetches a list of persons from an API and displays them 10 at a time, with a "Next" button to navigate through the pages. 

-This project serves as a good starting point for learning how to fetch data and implement pagination in React.
